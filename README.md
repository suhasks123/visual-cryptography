# Shared Bank Account Management System

## About:
This application uses Visual Cryptography to implement a management system for a shared bank account.

A shared bank account can be modified only when all the concerned entities agree on the transaction. This makes use of visual cryptography to split a shared password among all the maintainers of the account and the bank server. In this way, no transactions can happen unless everyone approves it. This is a form of strong consensus to make sure the security and integrity of the data is maintained.

This is a course project for Cryptography and Applications Lab(CS352) taught by Dr. Alwyn Roshan Pais, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
